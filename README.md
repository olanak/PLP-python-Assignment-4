# PLP-python-Assignment-4
# 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge

A simple Python program that reads a file, modifies its content, and writes the result to a new file.  
Includes **error handling** for missing files, permission issues, and unexpected errors.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Reads text from a user-provided file.
- Modifies the content (converts it to **UPPERCASE** in this version).
- Saves the result to a new file with prefix `modified_`.
- Handles errors gracefully:
  - File not found
  - Permission errors
  - Unexpected exceptions
